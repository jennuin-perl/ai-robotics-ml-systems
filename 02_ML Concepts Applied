## Machine Learning Concepts Applied

Here are ML concepts I applied in my portfolio. I worked on large-scale computer vision and ML systems, 
primarily focusing on dataset integrity, QA governance, and enabling retraining and fine-tuning 
cycles that improved downstream inference accuracy.”

#Training = The model learns from labeled data.
#Inference = The trained model makes predictions on new data.

I worked heavily in the training data governance + quality layer that directly impacted inference performance.

That’s real ML lifecycle fluency.

Across robotics, computer vision, spatial modeling, sports analytics,
and sentiment analysis systems, the following ML concepts were applied
through data enablement, governance, and lifecycle management:

### Supervised Learning
Large-scale labeled datasets were created to support supervised learning
pipelines, enabling models to learn from validated ground-truth data.

### Computer Vision Object Detection
Applied object detection principles involving classification and bounding
box localization for humans, equipment, infrastructure, vehicles,
field geometry, and environmental objects.

### Video-Based Temporal Labeling
Supported action recognition and event segmentation by annotating
start/stop times, movement sequences, and temporal transitions in video data.

### Dataset Curation & Ground-Truth Integrity
Designed annotation standards and QA thresholds to ensure high-confidence,
accurate training datasets prior to model retraining.

### Iterative Model Retraining & Fine-Tuning
Enabled incremental dataset expansion to improve generalization,
precision, and object taxonomy coverage through retraining cycles.

### Human-in-the-Loop ML Systems
Supported ML workflows where human validation strengthened model accuracy
before progression into automated inference stages.

### Inference & Automated Detection
Contributed to systems that transitioned from manual annotation dependence
to automated object detection and classification during model inference.

### Spatial Recognition & Mapping
Supported models that learned environmental context, ground-plane footprint
estimation, obstacle detection, and navigation-aware spatial awareness.

### Risk & Priority Classification
Enabled NLP-based sentiment and classification models to automatically
prioritize high-risk feedback signals and reduce manual triage burden.

### Model Governance & Quality Control
Established QA gates and integrity thresholds to ensure only validated
data batches progressed to engineering teams for model retraining
and deployment pipelines.

###Project Focus:

# Expanding datasets
# Improving labeling quality
# Adding new object classes
# Increasing generalization
# Resubmitting validated batches
# Supporting improved model precision

Resulting in > model:

✔ Retraining
✔ Fine-tuning (in many practical CV workflows) 
  - In large CV systems, retraining often includes fine-tuning.
