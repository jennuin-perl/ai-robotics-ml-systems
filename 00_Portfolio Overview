## Introduction

This portfolio documents sanitized, non-proprietary system-level work
supporting large-scale artificial intelligence, computer vision,
robotics perception, and machine learning initiatives across multiple domains.

The projects described here span:

- Robotics perception and autonomous navigation
- Computer vision–based spatial modeling
- Video-based action recognition
- Sentiment analysis and NLP classification
- Human motion and risk assessment models
- Public sector and high-security AI enablement environments

These systems relied on millions of annotated images and video sequences
to train, refine, and operationalize machine learning models in dynamic,
real-world environments.

## My Role in the ML Lifecycle

My responsibility across these initiatives focused on **AI and ML data enablement, quality governance, and operational management**.

Specifically, I:

- Trained data analysts and engineers on domain knowledge and annotation standards
- Designed and enforced labeling taxonomies and consistency frameworks
- Managed large-scale annotation workflows across distributed teams
- Trained QA teams to validate data batches against defined integrity thresholds
- Performed quality audits to ensure dataset accuracy, completeness, and consistency
- Approved validated datasets for handoff to engineering teams for model retraining and deployment

If data integrity fell below established quality benchmarks, I led retraining efforts
with analysts and QA reviewers, reworked datasets, and ensured corrections were made
before allowing progression into the model retraining pipeline.

This governance ensured that only high-confidence, validated ground-truth data
was used to train perception and classification systems.

## Approach

Across all systems, my approach centered on:

- Treating training data as critical infrastructure
- Aligning annotation standards with model objectives
- Supporting iterative retraining cycles
- Bridging domain knowledge, data operations, and engineering teams
- Strengthening model reliability through disciplined quality control

The result was improved model performance, reduced manual rework,
and scalable AI systems grounded in high-integrity datasets.
